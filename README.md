## 📚 Programs

### 1. Simple Prime Checker

- **File**: [Prime_1.cpp](/Prime_1/prime_1.cpp)
- **Description**: This program checks if a given number is prime using a straightforward algorithm that checks for divisors up to half of the number.
- **Usage**: Run the program, input a number, and discover whether it's prime or not.

### 2. Optimized Prime Checker

- **File**: [Prime_2.cpp](/Prime_2/prime_2.cpp)
- **Description**: This program employs a more efficient algorithm that incorporates the "6k +/- 1" rule, making it faster at determining primality.
- **Usage**: Execute the program, enter a number, and it will swiftly determine its primality.

### 3. Fermat's Little Theorem Primality Test

- **File**: [Prime_3.cpp](/Prime_3/prime_3.cpp)
- **Description**: This program uses the Fermat's Little Theorem primality test. You can specify the number of tests to enhance confidence in the result. Modular exponentiation is utilized for efficiency.
- **Usage**: Run the program, select the number of tests, and input the number you want to assess for primality.
